# XWM X-window-manager
A simple stacking window manager written in python end xlib.

Free to use or modify

Requires:
- python3
- xlib
- python3-ewmh
- xdotool
- xterm
- xfonts (font lucida is used)

Very minimal:
- close button
- maximize button
- window moving (from the titlebar)
- window resizing (click in the bottom right corner of the window, if the pointer change just drag)
- menu (right click in the background; two options: execute xterm or exit from the wm)
- dock on top right:
    - right click in the text XWM to bring it to top
    - left click in an item (if any) to bring that window on top
    - right click in an item (if any) to have a kind of minimization, or restore it to top

Because this wm is minimal, many things are left out, and maybe never will be implemented.
